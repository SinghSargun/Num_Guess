# Num_Guess

Num_Guess is a Python game where you can test your guessing skills. The game features two modes: 'ME' (where you guess the number) and 'YOU' (where the computer guesses your number). Additionally, there are four difficulty levels to challenge players of different skill levels.

## Game Modes

### ME Mode

In this mode, you (the player) will guess the randomly generated number. You can choose from four difficulty levels:

1. **Kid:**
   - 10 chances
   - 10 hints

2. **Normal:**
   - 5 chances
   - 5 hints

3. **Sigma:**
   - 3 chances
   - 0 hints

4. **Gigachad:**
   - 1 chance
   - 0 hints

### YOU Mode

In this mode, the computer will guess the number, and you have to confirm whether its guess is correct or provide hints. The difficulty levels are the same as in the 'ME' mode.

## How to Play

1. Choose the game mode ('ME' or 'YOU').
